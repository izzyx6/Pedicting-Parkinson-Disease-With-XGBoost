Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that
 affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with 
a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but
 the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.

In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little 
or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech
 may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as
 your condition progresses over time. (Mayoclinic, 2020)
